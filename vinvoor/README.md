Keeping track of scans is cool and all but you need a place to show them.
That's what this does!

## Environment variables

For production the environment variables need to be set before building!
You can specify them in `production.env` which will be used by the Dockerfile

- VITE_BACKEND_URL (string) | URL for the backend
- VITE_DEFAULT_THEME_MODE (string) | Default theme for the frontend
